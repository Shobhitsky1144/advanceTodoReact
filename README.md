Live Heroku- https://todo-app1144.herokuapp.com/

 todo app with reactJS, just need two features in the app 
 
To add/edit/delete a todo

To display a list all todo

When we add a todo, it should get added via the keyboards ENTER button as well, not just clicking on the add button.

 use localStorage and can persist todo so that when we refresh the page, all my todo lists are still there that would be great.
